        Long ago there was a time when I felt all alone,<br />
        Nobody would talk as I stood out there on my own;<br />
        Wandering around the edge of every single game<br />
        'til that magic moment when I heard them call my name.
      </p>

      <div class="font-bold mb-4">
        <p class="text-brand-accent">Chorus</p>
        Come along, you belong,<br />
        Come along, like a song,<br />
        And when you come along<br />
        We are strong.

        <p class="mt-4">
          And we need you to come<br />
          Like the earth needs the sun,<br />
          Come along, you belong;<br />
          We are one.<br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now I know that when I speak there's someone there to hear.<br />
        There's someone there to help me when I struggle with my fear.<br />
        I always have to do my part; it's waiting there for me,<br />
        And if I start to wander off, I hear this melody<br />
      </p>

      <div class="font-bold mt-6 mb-4">
        <p class="text-brand-accent">Chorus</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you ever feel alone, just like I used to do,<br />
        Start to look around you cause we're lookin' out for you.<br />
        If you're small, we'll guide you;<br />
        If you're hurt, we'll help you out,<br />
        An arm around your shoulder,<br />
        And that old familiar shout:<br />
      </p>

      <div class="font-bold mt-6">
        <p class="text-brand-accent">Chorus</p>
      </div>
